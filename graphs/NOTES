types of graphs directed and undirectd 

adjacency matrix to adjacency list

vector<int>adjls;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
        if(adj[i][j]==1 && i!=j){
            adjls[i].push_back(j);
            adjls[j].push_back(i);

        }
    }
}

linear graph can be bipartite graph
any graph with even cycle lenght then also it is a bipartite graph
