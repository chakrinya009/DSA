it is a problem solving approach of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum

pros ---> simple , easy to implement
cons ---> in some cases they dont provide a globally optimum solution

problems on which greedy approach work has two properties
 i)a global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum
 ii)an optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to sub problems

1) activity selection problem
2) huffman coding
3) job sequence problem
4) fractional knapsack problem
5) prims minimum spanning tree
