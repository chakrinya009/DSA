MERGE SORT
  Usually done recursively
  Divide and Conquer (to break our problems into smaller problems to solve it)

QUICK SORT
  Recursive algo
  quick sort=pivot
  pivot means simply one of the items in the array that follows the 3 conditions after we sorted it
    a)correct position in final sorted array
    b)items to the left are smaller
    c)items to the right are larger
  before we sort 1) items from left that is larger than pivot 2) items from right that is smaller than pivot

HEAP SORT
  build-max-heap function :- creates max heap from unsorted array
  heapify function        :- similar to build max heap, but assumes part of array is already sorted
    we continously 
      1)create max heap
      2)remove largest items
      3)place item in sorted partition
